        The Royal Enclosure is the remains of a fortress-city in Gondar,
        Ethiopia. It was founded in the 17th century by Emperor Fasilides and
        was the home of Ethiopia's emperors. Its unique architecture shows
        diverse influences including Nubian styles. The site was inscribed as a
        UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979.
