        The Church of Saint George is one of eleven rock-hewn monolithic
        churches in Lalibela, a city in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia.
        Originally named Roha, the historical and religious site was named
        Lalibela after the King Gebre Mesqel Lalibela of the Zagwe dynasty, who
        commissioned its construction.
